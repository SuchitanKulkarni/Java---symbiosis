	 * Inheritance is nothing but the feature of oop in which the methods or properties 
	 * of the another class can be accessable by the another class by extending that class
	 * or we can say the child class can be able to access the properties of its parent class by extending the parent class.
	 * 
	 * type of inheritance is : 1. single level
	 * 							2. multi level
	 * 							3. heirarachical
	 * 							4. hybrid
	 * The Multiple inheritance can't be supported by the java because if we extend the two class in the single class then the compiler get confused that 
	 * which constructor must be executed first of extended class and java does not supports pointers as well.so to overcome this we can use interface for multiple inheritance.
